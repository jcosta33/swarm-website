# Review: {{title}}

## Summary

{{2–3 sentences: what changed, what is verified, what is not.}}

## Changed files

- `{{path}}`

## Requirement coverage

| ID | Result | Evidence | Human attention |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC-001 | Pass | `{{test}}` output pasted/linked | no |
| AC-002 | Unverified | no test output found | yes |

<!-- Results: Pass · Fail · Unverified · Blocked.
     A Pass needs pasted output, a CI link, or, for a manual Verify method, a
     named human's recorded observation (who judged, what they saw). An empty
     Evidence cell means Unverified, never Pass. Suite/typecheck output stays
     under the task's Verify items — the Run summary section digests it; a failed or
     missing suite routes below via the missing-test-output trigger. -->

<!-- Optional — structured evidence (ADR-0083; checked by C013): a coverage row may carry,
     directly beneath the table, a fenced code block whose info-string is
     `verify id=AC-NNN cmd="<the requirement's named Verify-with command>" result=pass|fail`.
     That info-string is the machine-checkable form `swarm check` / `swarm review` reconciles
     against the spec's named command; the block's body is the verbatim paste — for you and the
     spot-check — and is never parsed for a review result. Opt-in: a row may use only the free-form
     Evidence cell and stays a human-attention warning. The check surfaces a consistency fact
     (the recorded evidence names the requirement's own command and a pass), never a review result. -->

Spot-checked: {{which green row's evidence you re-ran yourself}}

## Change-plan coverage

<!-- Only when the task executes a change plan: one row per preservation
     guarantee / wave item, same columns as above. Delete otherwise. -->

| ID | Result | Evidence | Human attention |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{SPEC-x#AC-001 (preserved)}} | {{result}} | {{evidence}} | {{yes/no}} |

## Human attention

<!-- Route the exceptions, not the diff: unverified or failed requirements ·
     out-of-scope changes · risky files · missing test output · changed public
     interfaces · DB migrations · security-sensitive changes · new finding
     candidates · blocked questions · missing or unconvincing worker-boot
     provenance for a delegated task (no sources/guide evidence, a guide that
     silently failed to load, or a worker that left no task artifact at all) —
     investigate, don't rubber-stamp. A waived row records: who waived · which
     rows · why · expiry — the packet status becomes `waived` at merge
     (expiry semantics: the advanced lifecycle, in the Swarm repo). -->

1. {{exception — why it matters — suggested action}}

## Task status

<!-- At closeout, confirm the task's board row AND the task packet's own
     `status:` frontmatter are updated together — review-ready → closed (or
     blocked). A worker that boots from a stale packet inherits stale state.
     "Committed, runtime/human validation pending" = this packet `needs-human`
     + the task `review-ready`; don't invent new states. -->

{{board row + packet status updated to … }}

## Suggested decision

{{Merge / Merge with waiver (who · why · expiry) / Block until …}}
