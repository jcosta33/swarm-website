# Content sources and review cadence

This file tracks where the Swarm website's marketing copy comes from and when it
was last checked against the canonical framework docs.

## Canonical sources

The framework's canonical docs live in the `swarm` repo:

- <https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm/blob/main/docs/01-what-is-swarm.md>
- <https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm/blob/main/docs/ADOPTING.md>
- <https://github.com/jcosta33/swarm/blob/main/README.md>

## Page source map

| Page | Source files in `swarm` repo |
|---|---|
| `/` (homepage) | `docs/01-what-is-swarm.md` (problem statement, feature list), `README.md` (tagline) |
| `/what-is-swarm` | `docs/01-what-is-swarm.md` (definition, is/is-not lists, adjacent-tools table, failure-modes table) |
| `/the-loop` | `docs/02-basic-workflow.md`, `specs/design-system/spec.md` (loop diagram) |
