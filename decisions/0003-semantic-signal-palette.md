# DECISION-0003 — Semantic Signal Palette

## Context

The three-way visual language needs more than a warm primary color and a few
supporting accents. If accents are applied one-off, the site starts to feel
random: green can mean "good," "new," "review," or simply "different."

Corpus needs a small palette where every hue has a job, and that job repeats
across text, icons, lamps, rails, borders, hatching, and hover states.

## Decision

Use semantic signal roles instead of decorative color choice.

The base hue is core gold `#D88A24` (`HSL(34 71% 49%)`). Its exact complement is
blue `#2472D8` (`HSL(214 71% 49%)`), reserved for diagnostics and tooling, not
the public marketing palette. Public accents stay warm or tempered:

| Role | Hue | Job | Pattern |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Core | `#D88A24` / `HSL(34 71% 49%)` | Corpus identity, primary action, active state, current loop step | gilt rail / seal line |
| Evidence | `#B8C56F` / `HSL(69 43% 60%)` | review proof, verified output, pass states | checkpoint ticks |
| Greenfield | `#75C985` / `HSL(131 44% 62%)` | new repo, starter kit, first-run setup only | upright field rows |
| Brownfield | `#C08452` / `HSL(27 47% 54%)` | existing-project adoption, migration, repo history | diagonal survey hatching |
| Change | `#D07960` / `HSL(13 54% 60%)` | edits, fixes, run work, blocked or attention states | angled change hatching |
| Reference | `#82C8BD` / `HSL(171 39% 65%)` | docs, manuals, ledgers, catalogs, read-only rosters | horizontal ledger rules |
| Muted | `#BF7927` / `HSL(32 66% 45%)` | hardware chrome, counters, low-emphasis labels | brass ruler marks |

Color is assigned from the object or action, not from mood:

- New repo is greenfield.
- Existing project is brownfield.
- Review proof is evidence.
- Missing evidence is change/attention.
- Read-only catalogs and rosters are reference.
- Gold is reserved for Corpus identity and primary action.

Implementation follows the same rule. A role should use the shared CSS signal
variables for hue, pattern, and mark (`--signal-*`, `--signal-*-rgb`,
`--signal-pattern-*`, and `--signal-mark-*`) before adding any local treatment.
A local treatment may change layout, density, or strength, but it should not
invent a new meaning for green, brown, sage, clay, verdigris, or gold.

Visible semantic color should usually travel through at least three surfaces:
label text, icon/lamp, rail/border, hatch/mark, or hover state. If color appears
on only one isolated word or card, it reads as decoration and should be removed
or promoted into the full role treatment.

Role selectors must be able to override base component defaults. Generic
signaled surfaces should keep their default selector specificity low, then let
classes such as `signal-surface-greenfield`, `signal-surface-brownfield`, and
`signal-surface-reference` set the actual role variables. If the base selector
wins the cascade, every card falls back to core gold and the palette stops
meaning anything.

## Consequences

- Positive: accents now carry repeated product meaning instead of decoration.
- Positive: pattern and texture can reinforce color for users who do not read
  subtle hue differences.
- Positive: greenfield and brownfield setup paths become distinct and literal.
- Negative: future components must choose a role before choosing a color.
- Negative: one-off color flourishes need a product reason before they ship.
- Neutral: legacy aliases (`yellow`, `gold`, `orange`, `olive`, `brass`) remain
  as compatibility shims in `app/components/signalStyles.ts`.
