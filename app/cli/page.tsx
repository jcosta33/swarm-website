            The workflow itself is just conventions and files — you can run all of Calma with a text
            editor and a straight face. The CLI is optional: it scaffolds the workspace, runs the checks
            at a gate, and keeps one worktree per task so parallel agents do not trample each other. It
            is a helper, not an orchestrator, and it never renders the verdict. Use it for less typing;
            ignore it if you would rather orchestrate by hand.
