# AGENTS.md — corpus-website

<!-- Keep this file short — aim for ~100 lines. Agents read it on every task,
     so every line spends always-loaded budget. -->

## Corpus startup

1. Read the task packet you were given first. Follow its scope.
2. Read the linked spec (and change plan, if any) before touching code.
3. Do not implement behavior outside the task's scope — if a requirement can't be
   met as written, stop and say why instead of improvising.
4. Run every item under the task's `## Verify` and paste the real output. A claim
   without output counts as unverified.
5. Before finishing, re-read your own diff as a skeptic, fill the task's
   `## Run summary` section, and flip the task's board row in `status.md` to
   review-ready.

## Workspace

- The loop: Pull → Spec → Task → Run → Review → Close (+ Inventory / Change Plan
  for structural work).
- Specs: `specs/<feature>/spec.md` · tasks: `tasks/` · reviews: `reviews/` ·
  findings: `findings/` · intake: `intake/` · inventories: `inventory/` ·
  change plans: `change-plans/` · decisions: `decisions/` · board: `status.md`
- Templates: `templates/`
- Agent guides: `.agents/skills/` — Claude Code reads them via `.claude/skills`

## Project facts

- Next.js 15+ App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- Deployed to Vercel; `main` branch auto-deploys.
- App code lives in `app/`; global styles in `app/globals.css`.
- Components live in `app/components/`.
- Static assets in `public/`.
- Design system: warm chassis surfaces with semantic signal roles in
  `app/components/signalStyles.ts`: core gold, evidence sage, greenfield field
  green, brownfield umber, change red clay, reference verdigris, and muted
  brass.
- Tone: tongue-in-cheek, laid back, open-source. Avoid corporate buzzwords.

## Commands

| Slot | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| cmdInstall | `npm install` | install dependencies |
| cmdDev | `npm run dev` | local dev server |
| cmdBuild | `npm run build` | production build |
| cmdLint | `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| cmdTypecheck | `npx tsc --noEmit` | TypeScript check |
| cmdStart | `npm run start` | production server locally |

An empty or missing slot means **ask** — never invent a command. A Verify item
whose command cannot be resolved reads Unverified, not Pass.

## Agent role

You are an implementation or review worker for the Corpus website. Corpus
organizes the work; you perform the assigned task — and you never review your
own implementation.
